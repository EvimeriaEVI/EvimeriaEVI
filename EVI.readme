Let us introduce Evimeria.

We will use the blockchain to track transactions, verify 
the legitimacy of charities and ensure the safety of donations.

The purpose of the Evimeria Platform is to bring transparency and 
accountability to the field of charitable donations in an effort to stem 
corruption by allowing incoming cryptocurrency donations for specific 
causes or campaigns to be permanently viewable, audit-able and traceable.
